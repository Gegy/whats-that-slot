# What's That Slot
This mod is a simple utility that allows you to query which items can be placed in a specific slot by holding down **Left-Alt**.
You can also find this mod on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/whats-that-slot/).

This is particularly useful in modded environments where it may not be clear what items can be placed in a modded
GUI.

Relevant items can also be quickly transferred from your inventory by clicking on them in the query window:

This mod works client-only, so it does not need to be installed on the server to run!
